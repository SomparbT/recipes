Ingredients:
 - 1 lb. ground beef
 - Kosher salt
 - Freshly ground black pepper
 - 2 tbsp. butter
 - 4 large eggs
 - 4 slices cheddar cheese
 - 3 tbsp. mayonnaise
 - 1 tbsp. Sriracha
 - 4 hamburger buns, split and toasted
 - 8 slices bacon, cooked
 - 3 leaves lettuce

 Directions:
 1. Form beef into 3 equal-size patties. Using a small glass, cut out center of each patty to create a donut shape; combine excess meat to form a fourth patty and cut out center. Season patties generously with salt and pepper.
 2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add patties and cook 2 minutes, then flip. Crack an egg into center of each, season with salt and pepper, cover, and cook until egg whites are set, about 5 minutes more. Top with cheddar cheese and cover with lid to let melt, 1 minute.
 3. In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise and Sriracha. Spread on toasted buns.
 4. Serve burgers on toasted buns with cooked bacon and lettuce.
